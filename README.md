It enhances efficiency and productivity whereby well designed software speeds up business operations ,improves automation and minimizes human errors.
It enables global connectivity in communication tools,social media  platforms and collaboration apps.Exampleas are :Remote work,e-learning and online services
It creates job opportunities driving economic growth since most companies rely on software solutions to stay competitive in the digital economy.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The rise of Agile Development in the early 2000's -this  led to adoption of DevOps enhancing automation and deployment process ,it also transformed software development by promoting continuos integration.
The birth of software engineering- it encouraged the adoption of structured programming to improve code readability and maintainability.
The development of programming languages eg: Fortran ,C -It introduced compilers that translated high level code into machine language



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: Follows a fixed sequence; each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
Scenario: A construction management software used for large infrastructure projects, where requirements, designs, and timelines are fixed upfront to ensure the system meets legal and structural standards.
Agile: Works in sprints, allowing continuous feedback and improvements.
Scenario: A fitness tracking app where developers continuously improve features like step counting and calorie tracking based on user feedback in each sprint cycle.
Waterfall: Testing is performed after development is complete.
Scenario: A satellite control software where all system components must be tested together at the final stage to ensure proper integration before launch.
Agile: Testing is integrated throughout development.
Scenario: A food delivery app where developers continuously release and test small updates (e.g., improving real-time tracking or payment options) without waiting for a full system overhaul.
Waterfall: Comprehensive documentation is created before development.
Scenario: A government healthcare system where every process must be well-documented for legal and compliance reasons before development begins.
Agile: Less documentation, with more focus on working software.
Scenario: A startup launching a mobile e-commerce platform that prioritizes a quick release, testing with users, and adjusting features based on usage trends rather than extensive documentation.
Waterfall: Rigid and difficult to modify once a phase is completed.
Scenario: A banking system upgrade where regulatory approvals and compliance rules are strict. Once a phase (e.g., security design) is approved, changes would be costly and time-consuming.
Agile: Highly adaptable, allowing frequent changes based on user feedback.
Scenario: A social media app where user preferences evolve rapidly. Developers release updates every few weeks based on feedback from real users.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer is responsible for designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software applications.

Responsibilities include:
They write clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
Implement software features based on design specifications.
Debug and fix software issues and bugs.
Collaborate with designers, QA engineers, and other developers.
Optimize application performance for efficiency and scalability.
Stay updated with new programming languages, frameworks, and technologies
A Quality Assurance Engineer Ensures software meets quality standards by testing for bugs, functionality, and security.

Responsibilities Include:
Design test plans and test cases for different software functionalities.
Conduct manual and automated testing to identify defects.
Work with developers to troubleshoot and resolve issues.
Ensure compliance with industry standards (e.g., security, performance).
Document test results and recommend improvements.
Perform regression testing after software updates.

A Project Manager Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of the software project, ensuring it meets deadlines and business goals.

Responsibilities include:
Define project scope, timeline, and budget.
Coordinate tasks among developers, designers, and testers.
Communicate with stakeholders to align project goals.
Monitor project progress and identify potential risks.
Ensure the project follows Agile, Scrum, or Waterfall methodologies.
Resolve conflicts and remove roadblocks affecting the team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Importance of IDEs in Software Development
It boosts Productivity: Provides auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and quick debugging, reducing coding time.
Error Detection: Helps catch errors and bugs early with built-in debugging tools.
Code Management: Offers project organization features like file navigation and refactoring tools.
Integration with Tools: Supports plugins and extensions for additional functionalities, like Git version control or cloud deployment.
Examples of IDEs:Visual studio code,Eclipse
Importance of VCS in Software Development
Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project without overwriting each otherâ€™s code.
Code History Tracking: Keeps a record of all changes, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if necessary.
Branching and Merging: Enables developers to create separate branches for new features and merge them when ready.
Disaster Recovery: Protects code from accidental deletions or corruptions by keeping a backup of previous versions.
Examples of VCS:Git,GitHub


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Technical debt from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions can hinder future work, so incorporating regular code reviews and refactoring helps keep the codebase maintainable and sustainable
Tight deadlines may force rushed development and reduced quality; however, prioritizing tasks and planning realistic, iterative sprints ensures that key functionalities are delivered on time. ,
Changing requirements can lead to scope creep and delays, but regular communication with stakeholders and using agile methodologies help manage evolving needs.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves evaluating individual components or modules of software. These tests verify that a module produces the correct output for different inputs. By focusing on these specific units, developers can swiftly identify and resolve bugs early in the development cycle. This method not only simplifies the debugging process but also establishes a solid groundwork for the entire system.
Integration Testing: This involves testing how different components or subsystems interact with each other. A component might function perfectly on its own, but problems can occur when it connects with other parts of the system. For instance, a login feature may work fine independently, but integration testing verifies that it communicates effectively with the user authentication system, managing both valid and invalid credentials appropriately. This process is essential for uncovering interface problems and ensuring that all parts of the application operate smoothly together.
System Testing involves assessing the entire software system in its entirety. This phase includes testing the fully integrated application to confirm that it meets all specified requirements. It is a crucial step for ensuring that the complete system functions reliably and efficiently once deployed.
Acceptance testing is typically carried out by end users or clients. This testing aims to confirm that the software fulfills business requirements and delivers the expected user experience. During acceptance testing, scenarios that reflect real-world usage are simulated, and feedback is gathered to ensure the product functions as intended and meets user expectations. A successful acceptance test signifies that the product is ready for deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.

Its Importance
Improve Accuracy: Well defined prompts direct the model's attention to the intended topic, minimizing confusion.
Enhance Relevance: Precise instructions guarantee that the output matches the user's goals.
Increase Efficiency: By providing the model with appropriate context, users can achieve superior results more quickly, reducing the necessity for repeated attempts.
Mitigate Bias: Carefully crafted prompts can help lessen unintended biases in the responses.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:
Help me plan a trip.

Improved Prompt:
Create a detailed 7-day itinerary for a first-time visitor to Zanzibar that includes top cultural attractions, local dining recommendations, and budget-friendly activities."

Explanation:
The improved prompt is more effective because it specifies the destination (Zanzibar), duration (7 days), and target audience (first-time visitor). It also clearly outlines the key elements cultural attractions, dining recommendations, and budget-friendly activities ensuring that the response will be detailed, relevant, and tailored to the user's needs.
